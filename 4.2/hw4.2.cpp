1. Trace the following code, assuming that both first and second begin with a value of 1. What is the last
value printed?

8

2. Rearrange the following lines of code to produce a program that prints all digits of a positive integer n in
reverse order. Not all lines are useful.

-int result = 1;
.while (n > 0)
.{
. int digit = n % 10;
- if (digit != 0)
- {
- result = result * digit;
- }
. cout << digit;
, n = n / 10;
.}
.cout << endl;
-cout << result << endl;
